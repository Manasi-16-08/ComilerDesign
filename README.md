# Compiler Design

The **Compiler Design** repository contains coursework, assignments, practical programs, and resources related to the study and implementation of compiler construction concepts. Compiler design is a fundamental area of computer science that focuses on building software that translates high‑level programming languages into executable machine code or intermediate representations.

This repository may include implementations for lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, code optimization, and other phases of a compiler.

## Overview

Compiler design covers both theoretical and practical aspects of how programming languages are processed and translated by compilers. Topics typically include:

- Lexical analysis (tokenizing source code)  
- Syntax analysis (parsing based on grammar)  
- Semantic analysis (type checking and meaning)  
- Intermediate code generation  
- Code optimization and generation  
- Symbol table management and runtime environment  

These concepts help you understand how high‑level languages are processed behind the scenes and are essential for building language tools like interpreters, transpilers, or full compilers. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run or test code in this repository, ensure you have:

- A supported compiler or interpreter (C/C++, Python, Java — depending on implementation)  
- Tools for lexical or parser generation (e.g., Lex / Flex, Yacc / Bison) if used  
- Text editor or IDE for browsing and editing source files  

### How to Use

#### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Manasi-16-08/ComilerDesign.git
cd ComilerDesign
```

### Explore Components

- Open relevant folders for each compiler phase  
- Review source files and documentation in `docs/`  

### Run Examples

- For **lexical analysis** code, compile and run the tokenizer  
- For **parser code**, compile with grammar tools and test sample inputs  
- For **intermediate and optimization code**, run provided test scripts (if any)  

> *(Update specific commands once you know the language and tools used.)*

### Learning Resources

Compiler design theory topics include:

- Lexical & syntax analysis  
- Parser generators  
- Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)  
- Symbol tables  
- Code optimization techniques  
- Intermediate representation (IR) and code generators ([Compiler-s24](https://compiler-s24.github.io/))  

You can find many external references and textbooks on these topics extensively online.

### Contribution

This repository documents learning and practice for compiler design concepts. Contributions such as improved code examples, detailed explanation docs, or test cases are welcome via issues or pull requests.
